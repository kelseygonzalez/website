I'm a Lead Data Scientist in the Chief Analytics Office at IBM. I currently am the Technical Lead for the Finance and Planning team where we build revenue forecasts to gauge progress towards financial targets.  
Previously, I applied NLP to build recommendations for upskilling in the People Analytics domain. 

I hold a PhD in Sociology from the University of Arizona. My research focused on social networks, health behavior, diffusion, and communication technologies. In my PhD dissertation, I specifically studied how people search for information and rely on this information to inform their health behaviors and develop social norms, particularly during times of uncertainty. You can find some of my publications from journals like *Ethnic and Racial Studies*, *Sociological Perspectives*, *Journal on Migration and Human Security*, and the *Journal of Religion and Health* below.  

I am a [Posit Academy Mentor](https://www.posit.co/products/enterprise/academy/), [a Certified RStudio Trainer](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/) and a [Carpentries instructor](https://carpentries.org/instructors/). You can view some of my open source
