I'm a PhD Candidate in the School of Sociology at the University of Arizona. My research focuses on computational methods, advanced statistical methods, and social networks analysis in connection to thematic interests in social networks, social behavior, medical sociology, and panethnic identities.

I have a strong methodological background following my extensive quantitative and computational methods training at the University of Arizona. I have researched Latina/o Panethnicty, white fragility, and population health behaviors during  Covid-19, leading to publications in in *Ethnic and Racial Studies*, *Sociological Perspectives*, *Journal on Migration and Human Security*, and the *Journal of Religion and Health*.

Currently, I manage the survey data pipeline for a project supported by the [U.S. Department of Defense Minerva Research Initiative](https://minerva.defense.gov/) analyzing non-state actor governance in Colombia and Afghanistan. I am also building a survey investigating network resource activation supported by the [Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science](https://sicss.io/). Additionally, I am investigating racial disparities in happiness, textual networks of weightloss, convergent validity and correspondence of Google Trends, diffusion of misinformation in population networks, and developing visualization tools for multinomial logistic regression. 

I am a [Certified RStudio Trainer](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/) and a [Carpentries instructor](https://carpentries.org/instructors/). Locally, I am involved with data science education at the University of Arizona as a [Senior Data Science Ambassador](https://datascience.arizona.edu/ambassadors) for the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences and a [Steering Committee member](http://researchbazaar.arizona.edu/) for Research Bazaar Ariona. 

<!---Kelsey received her MA in Sociology from the University of Arizona in 2018 where she investigated the impacts of personal networks and homophily on individualsâ€™ perceptions of discrimination. Before coming to the University of Arizona, she earned her MPhil in Race, Ethnicity and Conflict from the Department of Sociology at Trinity College, Dublin in 2015.-->
