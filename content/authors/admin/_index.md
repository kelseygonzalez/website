Kelsey E. Gonzalez is a PhD Candidate in the School of Sociology at the University of Arizona. Her research focuses on computational methods, advanced statistical methods, and social networks analysis in connection to thematic interests in social networks, social support, medical sociology, and racial and panethnic identities.

Kelsey has a strong methodological background following her extensive quantitative and computational methods training at the University of Arizona. She collaborates with Corey Abramson uncovering the economic, educational and health-related outcomes of weight status, with Daniel Martinez investigating racial and ethnic identities of Latinos in the United States, and with Terrence Hill researching white fragility and individual responses to Covid-19.

Kelsey’s work appears in *Ethnic and Racial Studies*, *Sociological Perspectives*, *Journal on Migration and Human Security*, and the *Journal of Religion and Health*.

Kelsey received her MA in Sociology from the University of Arizona in 2018 where she investigated the impacts of personal networks and homophily on individuals’ perceptions of discrimination. Before coming to the University of Arizona, she earned her MPhil in Race, Ethnicity and Conflict from the Department of Sociology at Trinity College, Dublin in 2015.
