	abstract = {Purpose – Although recent work has made significant contributions to our
theoretical understanding of white fragility, more empirical work is needed to
establish the social causes of this particular form of racial stress. Our chapter
builds on previous research by assessing gender and socioeconomic variations
in white fragility.
Methodology/Approach – Data come from the 2018 Survey of White
Fragility, a convenience sample of 279 non-Hispanic white undergraduate
students aged 18 years and over attending two large public universities in
the southeastern and southwestern United States.
Findings – Results indicate that women tend to exhibit higher levels of
remorse fragility (feeling sad, guilty, and angry). There were no gender
differences in depletion fragility (feeling drained/exhausted, unsafe,
attacked, and confused). Parental education was unrelated to levels
of white fragility. Overall parental socioeconomic status was initially
associated with lower levels of remorse and depletion fragility, but these
associations were confounded by a general measure of nonspecific psychological distress.},
