abstract: "Objectives: We test whether the association between state religiosity
and distance travelled is moderated by population age during the novel
coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: Mobility is operationalized
as the state-level average median distance traveled from February 24 to
May 4 across the contiguous United States. Shelter-in-place rates are
operationalized as the state-level percentage of users staying home.
State religiosity is measured with an index of aggregated religious
identities, beliefs, and practices. Population age is indicated by the state
percentage of adults aged 65 and older. We model population mobility
using regression with state clustered robust standard errors. Results: We
observe that religious states tend to travel more during the early stages
of the pandemic. However, the behavioral risks associated with state
religiosity are less pronounced in states with larger elderly populations.
Discussion: We contribute to our understanding of the social patterning
of pandemic mobility in aging populations."
