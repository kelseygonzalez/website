              and distance travelled is moderated by population age during the novel
              coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: Mobility is operationalized
              as the state-level average median distance traveled from February 24 to
              May 4 across the contiguous United States. Shelter-in-place rates are
              operationalized as the state-level percentage of users staying home.
              State religiosity is measured with an index of aggregated religious
              identities, beliefs, and practices. Population age is indicated by the state
              percentage of adults aged 65 and older. We model population mobility
              using regression with state clustered robust standard errors. Results: We
              observe that religious states tend to travel more during the early stages
              of the pandemic. However, the behavioral risks associated with state
              religiosity are less pronounced in states with larger elderly populations.
              Discussion: We contribute to our understanding of the social patterning
              of pandemic mobility in aging populations.},
