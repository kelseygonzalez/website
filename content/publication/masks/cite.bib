  abstract = {Objective: Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention strongly recommends wearing masks or other protective face coverings in public to slow the spread of the coronavirus, the practice has been unevenly distributed in the United States. Methods: In this paper, we model county-level infrequent mask usage as a function of county-level Republican political leadership (percentage of votes for Donald Trump in the 2016 Presidential election), conservative Protestantism (percentage evangelical Christian), and right-wing media consumption (interest in Fox News). Results: Our analyses show that counties with greater support for President Trump (especially in counties won by Trump), greater affiliation with evangelical Christianity, and greater interest in Fox News tend to exhibit higher rates of infrequent mask use. Conclusion: Given the effectiveness of masks in limiting the transmission of respiratory droplets, conservative ideological resistance to public health may indirectly support the acquisition and spread of the coronavirus.}
