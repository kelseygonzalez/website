	abstract = {Research finds willingness to identify on panethnic terms is increasing among people of Latin American descent in the United States, as is the assertion of Latino-Hispanic panethnicity as a primary identity. The 2013 National Survey of Latinos found that one-fifth of respondents identified most often as “Hispanic/Latino” rather than with a “Hispanic origin term” or as “American”. Drawing on these data, we examine the sociodemographic factors associated with primary panethnic identification (PPI). We find that Democratic Party affiliation and Mexican heritage increase the overall likelihood of PPI. Having less than a high school education, identifying racially as “Hispanic/Latino” or “other race”, Spanish fluency, being a first-generation immigrant, and non- citizenship increase the likelihood of PPI over “American”. These results suggest Latino-Hispanic panethnicity may represent a reactive identity associated with politicization, marginalization, and racialization. Many Latino- Hispanics in the United States are opting for a racialized primary panethnic identity over an “American” identity. ARTICLE},
