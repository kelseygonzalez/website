This visualization aims to understand population behavior during the COVID-19
pandemic. I use aggregated human mobility data (how far people move each day) 
from Cuebiq, an offline intelligence and measurement marketing company, which 
partners with 86 apps to collect first-party location data. Different U.S. 
states have handled the Covid-19 Pandemic in vastly different ways, with some 
states still refraining from issuing stay-at-home orders. This has led to very 
different mobility behaviors by state. I show that the stay-at-home order 
successfully reduced movement during the week of March 23rd and April 13th, 
with Americans reverting towards pre-COVID-19 movement patterns in between.
