Animating your ggplots may sound daunting. However, you have to add a line or two extra of code and you have an animation! `gganimate` makes animation quite accessible for users of ggplot. 


A cheat sheet for what we'll cover today:    


* Types of Transitions
    + transition_reveal()  (good for mainly geom_line)
    + transition_states()  (good for geom_point, geom_bar, geom_col, etc)
        - splits up plot data by a discrete variable and animates between the different states.
    + transition_time()  (geom_point)    
        - Instead of transitioning over a discrete variable, the transition occurs over a continuous variable (Time)    
* Some extras
    + shadow_mark()    
        - This shadow lets you show the raw data behind the current frame. Both past and/or future raw data can be shown and styled as you want.    
    + shadow_wake()    
        - instead of leaving a more permanent mark, wake leaves a tail to show direction, but only reveals the past few states       
    + view_follow(fixed_y = TRUE)    
        - controls how your viewport changes as the transition occurs         
    + `anim_save()`    
        - It works much like `ggsave()` from ggplot2 and automatically grabs the last rendered animation if you do not specify one directly.

Let's load back up our data from the previous lessons on R by Adriana Picoral (picoral.github.io/resbaz_intro_to_r/parti.html) and from Kathryn Busby on ggplot2. I'll name the dataframe `avocado` because I can't remember what the other instructors named their data. We will also load our packages here. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
# install.packages("gganimate")
library(gganimate)
# install.packages("scales")
library(scales)
avocado <- read_csv("avocado.csv")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(downloadthis)
avocado %>%
  download_this(
    output_name = "avocado dataset",
    output_extension = ".csv",
    button_label = "Download data as csv",
    button_type = "default",
    has_icon = TRUE,
    icon = "fa fa-save"
  )
```
Avocado data is originally from www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices/data.

Let's explore our data a little bit..
```{r}
glimpse(avocado)
summary(avocado)
class(avocado$Date) #make sure `Date` is actually a date type 
unique(avocado$region)# what type of regions are included here?
```
You'll notice that our region variable is kind of all over the place. Because I've reviewed this before, I know we need to separate out the US level, states, regions, and cities so our graphs are on the same level.

```{r}
avocado_us <- avocado %>% filter(region == "TotalUS")
states <- c("California")
avocado_CA <- avocado %>% filter(region %in% states)
regions <- c("West","Southeast","SouthCentral","Plains","Northeast","Midsouth","GreatLakes","WestTexNewMexico","NorthernNewEngland")
avocado_region <- avocado %>% filter(region %in% regions)
avocado_cities <- avocado %>% filter(!region %in% c("TotalUS", states, regions))
```

We're finally ready to make some plots, and then build the animation into these plots. 

## transition_reveal()
This type of transition is the simplest and acts like a piece of paper is being removed from left to right over the top of the graph to slowly reveal the result. That's how I think about it, at least. This assume that your x axis is also what is included inside your statement transition_reveal().  

For this, let's first build a static line plot that has date on the x-axis. Looking through the data, we could use `AveragePrice` or `Total Volume` on the y axis, and we could disaggregate by region, size of avocado, or type (organic versus conventional).  

Let's stick to the totalUS aggregation dataset we made (avocado_us) and look at the average price of conventional and organic avocados over time. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = avocado_us, 
       mapping = aes(x = Date, y = AveragePrice, color = type)) +
  geom_line()
```

If we feel good on time, we can make a few adjustments to the plot before animating it.

```{r}
ggplot(data = avocado_us, 
       mapping = aes(x = Date, y = AveragePrice, color = type)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format()) +  # format that y axis! 
  scale_color_manual(values= c("darkgreen", "darkolivegreen3")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Average Price of US Avocados",
       caption = "Source: Kaggle")
```
  
  This looks a lot better. I one what happened the summer of 2015! Now let's animate this. The key to this animation is `transition_reveal()`. Inside of the function, we can write out x axis variable. While it will take a few moments to render, you should see an animated plot in your plots pane.  

```{r, eval= FALSE, results=FALSE}
ggplot(data = avocado_us, 
       mapping = aes(x = Date, y = AveragePrice, color = type)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format()) +  # format that y axis! 
  scale_color_manual(values= c("darkgreen", "darkolivegreen3")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Average Price of US Avocados",
       caption = "Source: Kaggle") +
  transition_reveal(Date)
```

Let's also save this, since each time we run the code it takes some time.  
```{r, eval= FALSE, results=FALSE}
anim_save(filename = "type_reveal.gif")
```

### Challenge
Take a few minutes to try and plot the changes in total volume of organic avocados across time for the different regions of the USA.

----

## transition_time()
Transition time creates new "layers" of the animation over a continous variable, usually time (i've never seen an exception to that). While this works best with geom_point, there's many other options you can play around with. 

Let's use two continous variables to plot this. Let's see how well price explains the volume sold of avocados for non-organic avocados (though, it's been awhile since I took Econ101). Let's do this for the different cities in the US, omitting states and regions. 

```{r}
avocado_cities_filtered <- avocado_cities %>% 
  filter(type == "conventional",
         Date > as.Date("2018-01-01"))
ggplot(data = avocado_cities_filtered,
       mapping = aes(x = AveragePrice, y = `Total Volume`, color = region)) +
  geom_point()
```

That legend is really going to get in the way. Let's remove it and customize the circles before animating. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = avocado_cities_filtered,
       mapping = aes(x = AveragePrice, y = `Total Volume`, color = region)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format()) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format()) +
  geom_point(aes(size = `Total Volume`), alpha = .6) +  
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "Avocados sold by price and city") 
```

In practice, the animation is basically layering a bunch of plots on top of each other, as if they were facet_wraps. When I'm planning out an animation, I often use facet_wrap like you learned this morning to see the different layers before I "assemble" them. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = avocado_cities_filtered,
       mapping = aes(x = AveragePrice, y = `Total Volume`, color = region)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format()) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format()) +
  geom_point(aes(size = `Total Volume`), alpha = .6) +  
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "Avocados sold by price and city") +
  facet_wrap(~Date)
```

Now we can move on to animating this. transition_time() will replace the previous dot, making it hard to see any trends. Let's add `shadow_wake` so we can see the direction between points.

One really cool trick I like to employ is writing in the subtitle what point in time we're currently animating. Before it didn't really matter because the date was on the x axis, but not its hidden. For that, we need to add some `{}` in the subtitle argument of labs. 

```{r, eval= FALSE, results=FALSE}
ggplot(data = avocado_cities_filtered,
       mapping = aes(x = AveragePrice, y = `Total Volume`, color = region)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format()) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format()) +
  geom_point(aes(size = `Total Volume`), alpha = .6) +  
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "Avocados sold by price and city",
       subtitle = "Date: {frame_time}") +
  transition_time(Date) +
  shadow_wake(wake_length = 0.2)    
```

Let's also save this, since each time we run the code it takes some time.  

```{r, eval= FALSE, results=FALSE}
anim_save(filename = "type_time.gif")
```

### Challenge

Can you use transition_time to show how the price of organic avocados change over time for California? 

---

## transition_state()
Transition_state() creates a new animation layer across a categorical variable instead of over time. 

```{r}
avocado_region_long <- avocado_region %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(`4046`,`4225`,`4770`),
               names_to = "size",
               values_to = "volume")
ggplot(data = avocado_region_long,
       mapping = aes(x = size, y = volume, color = size)) +
  geom_boxplot() 
```

Let's customize this a little to make it look nicer. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = avocado_region_long,
       mapping = aes(x = size, y = volume, color = size)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format()) +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of volume sold by Avocado Size")
```

It isn't particularly helpful that the previous view completely dissappears as in transition_time. Instead of using `shadow_wake()`, let's use `shadow_mark()` to the animated plot to keep the past views visible. 

```{r, eval= FALSE, results=FALSE}
ggplot(data = avocado_region_long,
       mapping = aes(x = size, y = volume, color = size)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format()) +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of volume sold by Avocado Size") +
  transition_states(size, state_length = 1, transition_length = 1) +
  shadow_mark(alpha = 0.3, size = 0.5)    
```

Let's also save this, since each time we run the code it takes some time. 

```{r, eval= FALSE, results=FALSE}
anim_save(filename = "type_state.gif")
```
